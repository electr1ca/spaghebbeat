[PLAY DA GAME](https://electr1ca.github.io/spaghebbeat/)

spaghebbeat is a music game project that i worked on a lot during 2018-2019. it's based in p5.js and it went through several reworks before settling on its current design; the premise always being that a noodley object determined which keys to press in time to the music's melody and beat (hence spaghebbeat!) there's a tutorial and a demo song included in the files when you start up the game
